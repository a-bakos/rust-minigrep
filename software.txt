Software engineering is a systematic engineering approach to software development.[1][2][3]

A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer software. 
The term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but may also lack connotations of engineering education or skills.

Engineering techniques are used to inform[clarification needed] the software development process[1][4] which involves the definition, implementation, assessment, measurement, management, change, and improvement of the software life cycle process itself. 
It heavily uses software configuration management[1][4] which is about systematically controlling changes to the configuration, and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration and code throughout the system life cycle. 
Modern processes use software versioning.
